# World Quest Party
This addon was designed to make the world questing experience more accessible, pleasant, and social. With the introduction of the pre-patch, fully automated world quest grouping via cross-realm Group Finder was disabled. With that removal, the experience of world questing was negatively impacted. World Quest Party (WQP) is here to help!

## How it works
1. You enter a world quest area.
2. WQP window appears:
    - If any parties are listed using WQP, you can join them with a single click.
    - You can also create and list your own party with a single click. When creating a party, WQP will also post a LFM in General chat (This will help non-WQP users join you by asking for a whisper for an automatic invite).
3. Once you have completed the world quest, WQP will prompt you to leave the party and hide the WQP window. On to the next world quest!

## WQP Commands
It is very much the intent of WQP to be as simple and straight forward as possible. Everything is designed to be automated and out of your way. With that said, sometimes things happen and addons run into quirks. See below for commands to help you if you're running into issues.

- `/reloadui` - Usually, a simple reload of the UI will fix any issues.
- `/wqp reset` - Manually reset the addon if you're running into any issues.

## Notes about WQP
- World Quest Party was built to create a simple, easy to use tool to help you group more easily with other players.
- You will only be grouped with people on your Realm & Connected Realms.
- You will only be grouped with players matching your War Mode setting.
- LFM Posts to General chat are throttled (spamming is bad).
