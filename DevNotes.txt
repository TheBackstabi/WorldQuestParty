Core goals

- Automated invite based on players doing the same WQ
- Shard-locked to prevent realm hopping
- Able to be utilized indirectly without the addon


Necessary info

- WQ ID

Actions

	:: - Comment on why this helps
	// - Comment on implementation, additional features, etc
	!! - Issues or possible roadblocks

- Join(?) automation chat channel on login
	// Need to investigate if this is truely necessary. Would prefer to keep the channel completely hidden.

- Post availability on entering WQ zone
	:: Notifies other users that this player is available
	
- Send acknowledgement back when other users are available for the same WQ the local user is on
	:: Gives the newly available player a full list of those that arrived before them
	
- Remove availability and drop group when exiting WQ zone or on quest complete
	:: Removes the player from other user's list
	!! Exiting a WQ zone is an oddity - Both entering/exiting trigger the same event (ObjectiveTracker_Update, with OBJECTIVE_TRACKER_UPDATE_WORLD_QUEST_ADDED as the reason param)
			Using a toggle implementationdoesn't work. Some WQs instantly trigger an exit, while others may not trigger an exit at all.
			May need a manual implementation (think WQGF's "Leave group?" button) when the event fires for a previously found WQ.
			
- Button to post to General chat for a specific WQ
	:: Notifies non-addon users that there is a group doing this WQ
	// Possibly have an option to automatically make this callout when creating a group?
	
- Auto-invite users that whisper with a keyword
	:: Allows for automated processing of non-addon users.
	// Option to enable/disable would likely be a good idea.
	// Additional settings may be nice, such as user-defined keywords, time-limit (if any).
	// Bonus - allowing anyone to be whispered in the group. If they have the addon, they can automate the invite by sending an addon message for the group lead to catch.
			removes the need to pass around group lead/raid assistant permissions when making fully manual invites.
